LinearEquation Class
    Instance Variables:
        private int x1 - x value of first coordinate
        private int y1 - y value of first coordinate
        private int x2 - x value of second coordinate
        private int y2 - y value of second coordinate
        private int rise;
        private int run;
        private double slope;
        private double yInt;
        private double inverse;
        private double distance;
        private String info;

    Constructor:
        public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)

    Method:

        public double calculateSlope

        public double yInt() - calculates the y intercept

        public String toString() - returns all the relevant info
            - slope of line (double)
            - y intercept
            - slope intercept form
            - distance between points (double)

        public String slopeIntForm() - returns the equation in slope intercept form

        public double getDistance() - returns the distance


Runner Class
    Step 1: ask user to enter first coordinate
    Step 2: ask user to enter second coordinate
    Step 3: Print out both coordinates
    Step 4: Set the numbers of each coordinate value to a variable using the substring method
    Step 5: Convert them to integers
    Step 6: Use the variables to create a new object using the constructor
    Step 7: call toString method
    Step 8: ask user to enter the x value of third coordinate (could be any value)
    Step 9: return the y value of that third coordinate
